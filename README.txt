NeuroGro is a software package to model neuron growth processes

The growth model is constructed based on three sub-models

* cell model - individual cell types are initialized into the system. They begin initially as spheres and grow into more complex shapes with time

* capillary model - capillaries provide essential chemicals to support cell growth. The capillary model is a graph-based structure that models the capillary network within the system. 

* diffusion model - chemical signaling and nutrient diffusion influence how each cell cell will grow with time. The diffusion model determines how these components are distributed within the system.
